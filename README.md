# RP4 NixOS matrix
NixOS configuration for a matrix server running on Raspberry Pi 4

This configuration for now lacks nearly all the features -- there is only a base system, nginx server and PWM is enabled for the root user.

The goal is to have configuration deployable after changing the single config to appropriate domain name, email address, etc.
